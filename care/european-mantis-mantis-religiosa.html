<p>Females up to 9cm (3.5in)</p>
<p>Males up to 7cm (2.7in)</p>

<h2>Moisture</h2>
<p>Higher humidity for i1-i3, Spray daily</p>
<p>For i4+, 50% humidity, Spray every other day.</p>

<h2>Sexing</h2>
<p>After i4, females will have a clearly defined 6 segments, while males will have 8. Adult males are very thin with long antennae while females are very stocky.</p>
</section>
<section id="lifespan">
<h2>Lifespan</h2>
<p>After molting to adult, females will last 6-8 months. Males generally last only 2-4 months. Lifespans can often vary due to things such as diet, rate of feeding, and temperature. The colder it is, the slower they grow.</p>
</section>
<section id="instars">
<h2>Instars</h2>
<p>This species can molt to adulthood between i7 and i9. Males generally mature one instar earlier than females.</p>
</section>
<section id="feeding">
<h2>Feeding</h2>
<p>This species is very aggressive and is not picky about prey. Feed them often to encourage growth.</p>
<p>i1-i3: D. melanogaster, D. hydei, Micro Roaches</p>
<p>i4-i6: House flies, Waxmoths, Small Roaches</p>
<p>i6-i9: Blue Bottles, Small-Medium Roaches, Hoppers, Waxmoths</p>
</section>
<section id="enclosure">
<h2>Enclosure</h2>
<p>Zilla enclosures work well if properly modified with mesh. Make sure any added mesh is taut and not loose. DIY setups are also popular because of this. When making a setup, try to add cross ventilation. When decorating your setup, avoid clutter and low hanging branches to prevent mismolts. Enclosures should be at least 2 times as wide as the mantis is long and 3 times as tall as the mantis is long. This will give them space to molt.</p>
<p>These mantises may do better when molting to adulthood on an incline rather than a horizontal surface, such as a mesh pyramid, as they are used to molting on grasses and other field plants. Large adult females may need a bigger setup than a 32oz.</p>
<p>Here are some guidelines:</p>
<p>i1-i3: 5.5oz deli container</p>
<p>i4-i5: 16oz deli container</p>
<p>i6-i9: 32-80oz deli container</p>
</section>
<section id="other-info">
<h2>Other Info</h2>
<p>The European Mantis can be found on all continents except Antarctica. They are an incredibly cannibalistic species. Do not cohabitate them and separate nymphs early. A newly hatched ootheca can experience cannibalism in as little as 12 hours after hatching. Cannibalism during pairing is a common occurrence in this species. Oothecae need diapause, a chill period, over the winter to hatch. This can be simulated in a fridge.</p>
